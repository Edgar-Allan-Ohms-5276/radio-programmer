# EAO Radio Programmer

This is an FRC Radio Programmer that acts as an alternative to the programmer provided by FIRST. It sports an intuitive and clean user interface, faster flash and program times, and the ability to enable kiosk mode for offseason FMS, Nevermore FMS, or the official FMS.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to provide an open source alternative to the [FRC Radio Programmer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html) software that is fast and easy to use, and allows teams and individuals to explore the inner-workings of the software.
